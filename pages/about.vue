            <p>
              I'm a software developer located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.
              My passion is building modern, highly scalable web applications
              with Typescript using
              <a href="https://nestjs.com" rel="nofollow">NestJS</a>, and
              <a href="https://nuxtjs.org" rel="nofollow">NuxtJS</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a young age, my parents knew I would have a future with
              technology. This idea probably formed from the many instances they
              had to ground me after finding me on the computer past curfew.
            </p>
            <p>
              While in elementary school I was fortunate to have access to
              computers at home, as well as the support of my parents to build
              my own computer. My passion for software development was first
              sparked by the world of video games, but quickly transformed into
              excitement around hosting and managing dedicated linux game
              servers. After understanding the difficulties of managing servers
              from the command line I began my journey into web development by
              creating tools that would help friends manage server instances
              from webpages.
            </p>
            <p>
              In junior year of high school, I realized that software
              development was the career path I wanted to pursue. With an
              interest in web development and server administration I was keen
              on studying computer science at university. A background in
              computer science has primed me with tools and the knowledge to
              build web applications that exceed expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now working in industry, this passion remains. I constantly push
              myself to understand new technologies to deliver the best
              experiences possible. There is certainly a mountain more to learn,
              and more problems to solve; knowing this is what keeps me
              enthusiastic and drives me everyday.
